Homework 2

My Favorite Colors

Use div tags, positioning, and CSS color codes to put paint on an artist's palette

Step 1 - Add the HTML
In index.html:
1. Inside the .container div, add 5 div tags. 
2. Give each div tag the same class name.
3. Give each div tag a unique id.


Step 2 - Shape and add color with CSS
In style.css: 
1. Select all the new div tags using their shared class name.
    Set width, height, position and border-radius.
    Hint: try playing with width and height to make an oval shape.
2. Select each div by its unique id.
    Set its top position.
    Set its left position.
        You will have to experiment with these values to postion the paint on the palette.
    Choose your favorite color for the background-color. 
        Don’t forget to use CSS color codes: hexidecimal, RGB, and/or RGB.
