Homework 1: Color the Heading Text

Use CSS color codes to color the heading text

Step 1
In index.html
    1. In your h1 header, wrap <span> </span> tags around a word, or the letters in a word.
    2. Give each span tag a unique id. 
    Hint: Pick id names that match the word you're styling, that way you won't forget which word or letter you're styling when you're working in the CSS file.
        id="what"
    You can even wrap span tags around individual letters. You could make the word rainbow into a rainbow of colors!

Step 2
In style.css:
    3. Select each span tag, and change the text color to whatever you want. If you've forgotten how to apply color to text, look in a previous project, or look it up online.
    4. Make sure to use CSS color codes: hexidecimal, RGB, and/or RGB.
